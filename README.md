# Lurch

[Project website](http://lurch.plus).

This repository is currently not under development and incomplete. It was formed from the union of three smaller repositories, now housed in the `core`, `engine`, and `app` folders of
this repository.  For that reason, you might find some pieces of the
documentation that haven't yet been updated to account for the fact that we have
merged everything into one repository, but that may improve with time.  

The official Lurch repository is at [lurch.plus](http://lurch.plus).  Developers and instructors interested in using Lurch or adding features should fork that repository as it is the most up to date.

<!--
This repository was intended to serve two purposes:

 1. The developers of the Lurch project work in this repository, and anyone who
    is interested in browsing or improving the app code can work here as well.
 2. It is possible to use this repository to create your own Lurch Site, which
    is a website hosting an instance of the Lurch app that you have configured
    for your own needs (or the needs of your students).  To learn how, check out
    [How to Create a Lurch Site](https://lurchmath.github.io/site/how-to-create-a-lurch-site/).
