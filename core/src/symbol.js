 * summation.
 * 
 * The primary datum stored in a Symbol is a single text string, which defines
 * the symbol.  For more information on this datum, see the constructor.
 * 
 * Note:  It is unfortunate that we have a class named Symbol in our
 * ontology while JavaScript also has a class named Symbol.  We therefore
 * always import this class using code like the following, to ensure no
 * conflicts in the global scope would prevent us from accessing the original
 * JavaScript Symbol functionality, which we occasionally need.
